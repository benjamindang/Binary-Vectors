# Binary-Vectors

## This program is designed to fully implement a class called Integer. The Integer class is designed to store user inputed integers as vectors of boolean's to represent their binary equivalence in sign and magnitude form. The class relies on operator overloading to allow more convient access to performing addition, mulitplication, and subtraction with Integer objects, which is all done through bitwise arithmetic. Furthermore, these objects can be input as a negtive or positive integer. The class also overloads many of the comparison operators as well as pre and post fix increment/decrement operators. Nonmember functions featured in the program are a base addition and multiplicaiton function, as well as operator overloading for comparison operators.

### Please find inside the BinaryVectors.cpp file more descriptions of each individual functions. Overall, the class utilizes two's compliment to allow for easy implementation of adding and subtracting negative/positive numbers with each other. Further, a simple main function is written to showcase the capabilities of the Integer class.
